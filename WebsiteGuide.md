## Adding a New Publication
Each new publication needs to go into a bibtex file: https://github.com/LearnDialogue/ld-website/blob/master/public/pubs/LearnDialogue.bib

To add a publication, duplicate the @inproceedings closest to the top of the document. Modify the "title", "author", "booktitle", etc. If the preceedings have not yet been published, there will not yet be page numbers. This field will need to be added once the proceedings are published. 

Once the camera-ready has been completed, the bibtex's "url" field will need to be updated and the pdf will need ot be updated. The pdf's name and the URL will need to match. The camera-ready will need to be put into the following folder: https://github.com/LearnDialogue/ld-website/tree/master/public/pdf
